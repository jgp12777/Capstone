1️⃣ Download / install NativeWebSocket from GitHub
We’re going to use Unity’s Package Manager to pull it directly from the GitHub repository. This is the easiest way.
Step-by-step:
	1	Open your Unity project.
	2	Open Package Manager
	◦	In Unity Editor → top menu: Window → Package Manager
	3	Add package from Git URL
	◦	Click the + button (top left of Package Manager)
	◦	Select Add package from git URL…
	4	Enter the GitHub URL https://github.com/endel/NativeWebSocket.git
	5	
	◦	Click Add
	6	Wait for it to import
	◦	Unity will download the package and make it available for your scripts.
	◦	You don’t need to manually download anything.
✅ Now using NativeWebSocket; works in your script.

Notes:
	•	Make sure you are online when you do this.
	•	If Unity gives an error about Git, make sure Git is installed on your system and available in PATH.

2️⃣ Where to put the BCIWebSocketClient.cs script
	1	In your Unity project, go to the Assets folder.
	◦	You can see it in the Project window in Unity.
	2	Create a folder for scripts (optional but recommended)
	◦	Right-click → Create → Folder → name it Scripts
	3	Create or import your C# script
	◦	Right-click the Scripts folder → Create → C# Script
	◦	Name it BCIWebSocketClient
	◦	Open it and replace all code with the script I provided
	◦	OR drag-and-drop an existing .cs file into the Scripts folder
	4	Attach the script to a GameObject
	◦	Select a GameObject in your scene (like a Cube)
	◦	Drag the BCIWebSocketClient script onto the GameObject → it will appear in the Inspector
	◦	This GameObject is now “listening” to the WebSocket messages
	5	Optional: adjust parameters in Inspector
	◦	Server Url → ws://localhost:8080 (default is correct)
	◦	Confidence Threshold → default 0.6, adjust as needed

✅ Quick check
	•	Server running: node bci_sim_server.js
	•	Unity scene running with cube & script attached → cube should react to simulated commands
	•	Unity console → logs incoming messages and actions
