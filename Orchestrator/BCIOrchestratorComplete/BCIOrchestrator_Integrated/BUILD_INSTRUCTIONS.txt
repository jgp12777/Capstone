BCI ORCHESTRATOR - BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

QUICK BUILD (Recommended)
--------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to this folder:
   cd "C:\path\to\BCIOrchestrator_Integrated"
3. Run the build script:
   build.bat


MANUAL BUILD (If build.bat fails)
----------------------------------
Method 1: Using your .NET 9 SDK
   cd "C:\path\to\BCIOrchestrator_Integrated"
   dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o ./Release

Method 2: If you want to use .NET 9 directly (instead of .NET 8)
   1. Edit BCIOrchestrator.csproj
   2. Change line 5 from:
      <TargetFramework>net8.0-windows</TargetFramework>
      to:
      <TargetFramework>net9.0-windows</TargetFramework>
   3. Then run:
      dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o ./Release


TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------

Problem: "Specify a project or solution file"
Solution: Make sure you're in the correct folder!
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Type: cd "C:\path\to\BCIOrchestrator_Integrated"
   - Type: dir
   - You should see: BCIOrchestrator.csproj
   - Then run: build.bat

Problem: ".NET SDK not found"
Solution: Install .NET SDK
   - Download from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
   - Install .NET 8 SDK (recommended) or .NET 9 SDK (also works)
   - Restart your command prompt
   - Try again

Problem: "error NU1100: Unable to resolve..."
Solution: Restore packages first
   dotnet restore
   Then try building again

Problem: Build succeeds but no .exe appears
Solution: Check the Release folder
   - Look in: BCIOrchestrator_Integrated\Release\
   - You should find: BCIOrchestrator.exe
   - If not there, check: bin\Release\net8.0-windows\win-x64\publish\


VERIFICATION
------------
After building, you should have:
   BCIOrchestrator_Integrated\Release\BCIOrchestrator.exe

File size should be around 60-70 MB (self-contained)


RUNNING THE APPLICATION
------------------------
Option 1: Double-click the .exe
   Navigate to Release folder
   Double-click BCIOrchestrator.exe

Option 2: Use run.bat
   From the main folder, run: run.bat
   (This will guide you through options)

Option 3: Command line
   cd Release
   BCIOrchestrator.exe --help


WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE .NET SDK?
-------------------------------
You have two options:

Option A: Install .NET SDK (recommended for building)
   1. Go to: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
   2. Download .NET 8 SDK or .NET 9 SDK
   3. Install it
   4. Build the project

Option B: Use pre-built binaries (if available)
   - Skip building entirely
   - Use a pre-compiled .exe file
   - You would still need .NET Runtime to run it
   
   
CREATING A PORTABLE VERSION
----------------------------
The --self-contained flag means the .exe includes .NET runtime
This makes it ~60MB but works on ANY Windows 10/11 machine
No .NET installation required on the target machine!

To create a smaller version (requires .NET runtime on target):
   dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o ./Release
   (This will be ~10MB but needs .NET 8/9 runtime installed)


COMMON DIRECTORY MISTAKES
--------------------------
WRONG:
   C:\Users\Josh\Downloads> build.bat
   (Running from Downloads folder - won't work!)

CORRECT:
   C:\Users\Josh\Downloads\BCIOrchestrator_Integrated> build.bat
   (Running from inside the project folder - works!)

To check you're in the right place:
   dir BCIOrchestrator.csproj
   (Should show the file, not "File Not Found")


NEXT STEPS AFTER BUILDING
--------------------------
1. Configure Emotiv App:
   - Open Emotiv App
   - Settings → OSC
   - Enable BCI-OSC
   - IP: 127.0.0.1
   - Port: 7400

2. Run the orchestrator:
   cd Release
   BCIOrchestrator.exe

3. Test the connection:
   - Open test_client.html in browser
   - Should see "CONNECTED"

4. Test without Emotiv (optional):
   Open PowerShell and run:
   $udp = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.UdpClient
   $bytes = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("push,0.85")
   $udp.Send($bytes, $bytes.Length, "127.0.0.1", 7400)


NEED HELP?
----------
1. Read QUICKSTART.md for 5-minute setup
2. Read README.md for full documentation  
3. Read TESTING.md for debugging help
4. Check logs in: logs\orchestrator.log (after running)


==========================================
Still having issues? Make sure:
- You're in the correct folder
- .NET SDK is installed
- You have internet connection (for package restore)
- Windows Defender isn't blocking the build
